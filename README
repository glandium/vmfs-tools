vmfs-tools - Tools to access VMFS filesystems
=============================================

Originally loosely based on http://code.google.com/p/vmfs/ from fluidOps,
this set of tools has since evolved to handle more features from VMFS, such
as extents, and allows to access VMFS through the standard Linux VFS with
the help of the FUSE framework.

While it is still work in progress and is not destined for production use
yet, it can be of some help for some people.

Build and install instructions
------------------------------

To get a full build of vmfs-tools, you need the following prerequisites:
- gcc
- GNU make
- libuuid's development files
- pkg-config
- libfuse's development files
- asciidoc
- xsltproc
- docbook-xsl

From the above list, only the first three are strictly required.

The lack of libfuse's development files will result in the vmfs-fuse
program not being built.

The lack of asciidoc, xsltproc or docbook-xsl will result in no
manual pages (though you can still look at the .txt files within the
source tarball).

Building vmfs-tools should be as simple as running `make' or `gmake`,
depending on how GNU make's binary is named on your system.

To install vmfs-tools, just run `make install' (or `gmake install').
The install location for the binaries is $prefix/sbin, $prefix/share/man
for the manual pages, where $prefix is /usr/local by default.

If you wish to install to some other place, you can override $prefix with
the command `make install prefix=/some/where'.

Supported platforms
-------------------

vmfs-tools has been verified to build on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD 7.2 and
Opensolaris 2009.06.

On FreeBSD 7.2, you will need to install e2fsprogs-libuuid and pkg-config
so that the system uuid.h header is not used: it provides an incompatible
definition of the uuid_t type.

On Opensolaris, if you use the gcc-4.3.2 package instead of SUNWgcc, you
need to set EXTRA_LDFLAGS to -L/lib. This can be done with the command
`make EXTRA_LDFLAGS=-L/lib'. (you may need to use `gmake' instead of `make',
depending on your system)
